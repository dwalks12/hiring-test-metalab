Just some side notes.

* May wanna suggest others to npm install --save babel-core too, seems 6.0.0 is outdated for some of your packages. (I had to update in order for it to work, same with json5 module)
* Maybe also nvm update to make sure version manager is the same
* I used google design for the icons, and used google fonts Open Sans for font. Hope thats cool.
* may want to consider some hot reloading plugin for webpack, instead of refreshing all the time.
* its not fully mobile friendly, given a bit more time could have made it pretty on mobile.
 

Was fun to do. Like how you have your own babel presets thats pretty cool.

Hope you like this! I'll be back in Vic around Christmas.
As the Danes say

Mange tak.
